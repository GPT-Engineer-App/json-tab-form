# json-tab-form

I want to make a javascript graphical interface with two tabs. The first tab is a form with two fields called class, which is a dropdown meny with two options "cat" and "dog" and the second is called name, which has a free text field. The second tab shows a json representation of the first tab, including the information added through the form. There is a button for saving the json to file.
